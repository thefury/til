# The POTA Day Resets and Midnight UTC

There are a number of criteria used to determine if a QSO from a hunter counts
towards a POTA activation: mode, band, park, and day must be unique. For instance,
using CW, SSB, and FT-8 on 20m would count as 3 contacts. This is per day.

I didn't realize that the day was defined as a UTC day. Aa contact made and 18:00
and one at 19:30 would count as two separate days as EST 19:00 == UTC 00:00.
